# Backup reminder

A simple application to remind me to run a back up each day.

It has options to cancel the backup or shutdown once the backup is complete.

## Usage

If you want to modify this for your own use, you'll likely want to change the
backup command (I use `duply`) and call it each day from a cron job.
